## Reality (C++ Rewrite by Kitten)
===
This is a rewrite for Reality using C++ and SFML(which uses OpenGL in contrast to DirectX).
Feel free to commit, but test it.  
_**MAKE SURE YOU USE VISUAL STUDIO 2015!**_

http://sfml-dev.org

Some SFML dlls are included. 
Make sure you put the _**x86**_ VS 2015 SFML in the location "C:/SFML-2.3.2"


(also, if this game is done right, it should get AMAZING fps! Just sayin')

### Upcoming
===
* **Rendering Code!**
* Maybe do calculations in a seperate thread?
* Shove SFML stuff right into the project so you dont have to download it seperatly
