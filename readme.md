## Reality (C++ Rewrite by Kitten)
This is a rewrite for Reality using C++ and SFML(which uses OpenGL in contrast to DirectX).
Feel free to commit, but test it.  


### Setting up the enviroment
_**MAKE SURE YOU USE VISUAL STUDIO 2015!**_  
Download the latest SFML here: http://sfml-dev.org  
Rename the folder with the 'include' and 'bin' and stuff like that _inside_ of it 'sfml'  
Put that new 'sfml' folder into the same folder 'RealityCpp.sln' is in.  
Double click 'RealityCpp.sln' and VS 2015 should load.  
Success!  

Also do not upload the the sfml folder in a pull request, but the .gitignore should automatically ignore it.

### Upcoming
* **Rendering Code!**
* Maybe do calculations in a seperate thread?
* Shove SFML stuff right into the project so you dont have to download it seperatly  
(also, if this game is done right, it should get AMAZING fps! Just sayin')
